Life Expectancy analysis 

Life expectancy is a critical measure of the overall health and well-being of a population. It serves as a vital indicator of the standard of living and provides valuable insights into the social, economic, and medical conditions of a society. We will be using the Life Expectancy Data by WHO. In this data we will be examining the factors that affects the Life Expectancy considering demographics variables, income composition and mortality rates. This data considers data from 2000 to 2015 for all the countries and looks more into the intricacies of life expectancy by examining various factors such as immunization, mortality, economics, and other health-related indicators. These multiple country data aim to identify which factors have the greatest impact on life expectancy and in turn, provide insights to countries on which areas they focus on to enhance the health of the population. It will help us know the factors that affect life expectancy and contribute towards its improvement.
